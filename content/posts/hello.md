Hello, this is a test.
Welcome to my website.

This is a revival of [kangzhe.xyz](https://kangzhe.xyz).
My friends have been asking me to bring it back.

I hope with this blogs feature I can also make myself write more about whatever it is that I want to write about (though figuring out all this Hugo stuff is still a pain).

## A header, big text.
And here's some math, $1+1=3$, and 

$$(\forall \epsilon > 0) (\exists \delta > 0) [|x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon].$$

Looking forward. よろしくお願いします。


```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello world")
```
