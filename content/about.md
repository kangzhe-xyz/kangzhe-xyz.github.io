Hello, my name is Kang Zhe.
Welcome to my website.

I am a third year undergraduate student in the National University of Singapore studying pure mathematics.
I am interested in logic.

My other projects include learning Japanese, and attempting to read [The Art of Computer Programming in Japanese](https://asciidwango.jp/post/122327235600/the-art-of-computer-programming-volume-1).
Some of my friends have introduced me to this book, and I thought it would be a good idea to try doing it in Japanese.

I sometimes also solve [twisty puzzles](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016KANG02).
You might be able to find me in local competitions in Singapore.

I can be contacted at nkz dot u dot nus dot edu.
Feel free to disturb me.

## Classes I am Taking This Semester
I am taking the following classes in 25/26 Semester 1:
1. MA4198 Mathematics Capstone Project (on Hilbert's 10th Problem)
2. MA3201 Algebra 2
3. MA3209 Metric and Topological Spaces
4. MA3264 Mathematical Modelling
5. LAJ3202 Japanese 6

This is considered a slightly lighter semester for me, but I still face difficulty.
