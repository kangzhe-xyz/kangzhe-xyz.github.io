I suck at reading, but I would love to love it and get better at it.
It is a skill that I did not develop when I was younger, as the poorly disciplined child I was---but I am looking forward to read more to understand the world better.

I am currently interested in reading Japanese literature, mainly for language learning purposes.

I am semi-active in the [JSS Book Club](https://www.instagram.com/nusjapaneselit/)---a subclub under the [NUS Japanese Studies Society](https://jss.sg/).

## Currently Reading
- 日本随筆家協会編 --- 『心に残る話』
- 有川浩 --- 『旅猫リポート』
- Yuri Matiyasevich --- *Hilbert's 10th Problem* (this is for one of my classes)

## Books I'm Working Through
I consider this a separate section, since reading a math book with exercises is quite different from reading a novel.
- David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote --- *Abstract Algebra*
- James Munkres --- *Topology*
- Donald E. Knuth --- *The Art of Computer Programming* Volume 1 (日本語版)
